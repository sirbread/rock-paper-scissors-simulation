remember that one video you saw on tiktok a while ago? i made it lol
https://youtu.be/Ffkuzy50UNM

a simple Pygame-based simulation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where three types of "entities" (Rock, Paper, Scissors) interact based on their types. Each entity behaves with different movement patterns according to the classic rules:
- Rock chases Scissors but avoids Paper.
- Paper chases Rock but avoids Scissors.
- Scissors chase Paper but avoid Rock.

## Features

- **Dynamic Movement**: Entities move towards their targets or away from threats, with randomized directions.
- **Tribal Conversion**: Entities within a certain radius of their targets convert them to their tribe.
- **Pause and Play**: Pause the simulation by clicking. (yes this is a feature)
- **Win Detection**: The game declares a winner when only one tribe remains.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

aaalsoooo theres another bugged out python file in assets but it has a cool visual effect so i kept it :3
